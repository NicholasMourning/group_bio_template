    <h2>Inspiring figure</h2>
<h3> Grace Hopper</h3>

<p>Grace Hopper was an influential figure in the computer science industry. She is known for shaping the trajectory of early software development. She played a key role in creating one of the first high-level programming languages, COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language). This language democratized computing by making it more comprehensible and accessible to programmers. She also introduced the idea of machine-independent programming and championed the concept of "write once, run anywhere", an ideology that laid the groundwork for the development of compilers. These tools translate human-readable code into instructions that machines can understand.

    <h2>Favorite tool</h2>
<h3>Git-hub Desktop</h3>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/1*p6exlg2Jrl3pimjPy7R-sA.png" alt="Git-hub desktop">
    <p> Git-hub desktop is a goated application that reduces the learning curve of Git.</p>
    <p>Reasons why I love it: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It has buttons to commit, push, pull etc. (reduces the need to memorize commands)</li>
        <li>Easy to sync changes with team members, it shows who made what changes and when.</li>
        <li>Helps you learn Git workflow(staging, commiting, branching) without needing a terminal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I like the idea that we can use artificial intelligence to enable computers to learn from data
    and make predictions or decisions without directly coding every single task. </p>
